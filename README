go is a universal command-line launcher for GNOME.
Much like gnome-open, but it can launch programs as well.
Always in a new window, always fully detached from your terminal.

$ go             # launch a new gnome-terminal window
$ go <file>      # open <file> in your preferred application
$ go <URL>       # open <URL> in your preferred application
$ go <CLI-prog>  # launch command-line program in a new gnome-terminal
$ go <GUI=prog>  # launch GUI program
$ google <words> # launch google search for <words> in default browser
