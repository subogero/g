A collection of goodies for Linux desktop environments.
g is a universal command-line launcher.
tapeta is a simple wallpaper slideshow program.
notgmail provides desktop notifications for new email on Gmail.

g is much like gnome-open, but it can launch programs as well.
Always in a new window, always fully detached from your terminal.
$ g             # launch a new terminal window
$ g <file>      # open <file> in your preferred application
$ g <URL>       # open <URL> in your preferred application
$ g <CLI-prog>  # launch command-line program in a new terminal
$ g <GUI-prog>  # launch GUI program
$ g -g <words>  # launch google search for <words> in default browser

Use both tapeta and notgmail as Startup Applications.
